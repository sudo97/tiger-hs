# Modern Compiler Implementation in Haskell

This is a repo where I put my progress on (re-)implementing exercices and programs from [Modern Compiler Implementaion in ML](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/ml). It's nothing special right now, only an interpreter from chapter1 for existing AST. No Lexer, no Parser.
